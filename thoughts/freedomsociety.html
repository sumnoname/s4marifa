            Can you be free in a human society? I guess it depends on how we define freedom. 
            Do we mean freedom of choice? Then sure, there is <em>always</em> choice. 
            A more oppressive society will leave you with less choices, but there always will be choices, 
            whether that choice at any given time is to live by the rules and laws set by society or to 
            rebel against that very society that imposes these restrictions on you. But on a deeper level, 
            whatever choice you make, even in a <em>relatively free</em> society it is always a reaction to the 
            society you live in. There is no decision outside of the framework society made up, rules, 
            laws, tradition, culture. And don’t get me wrong, I understand that there is a need 
            for all of these things, I am in no way advocating for some sort of everything-goes-anarchy 
            and I am also not talking about what kind of restrictions are right or wrong. The actual point 
            I want to get at is, if we want to understand freedom, we have to experience it and that is 
            impossible while living in an organized society.
            <br><br>
            To experience proper freedom, you have to leave. Leave society. 
            Alone, not with your best friend or whomever. Not forever, for two weeks is enough to get 
            a taste of that freedom (a week might be enough, this depends on you!). Go to some woods or 
            whatever is appropriate for you. Make sufficient preparations, bring a tent and some supplies
            and so on, obviously. Don’t bring your smartphone or any device that lets you connect to 
            society in any way or form. Cut that cord for this short time!
            <br><br>
            You will experience a couple of things (and possibly more, but I will keep it short and on topic):
            <ul>
                <li><h4>The only things you actually need to satisfy are physical and immediate</h4>
                    Hunger and thirst, especially. Avoiding (extreme) cold and heat. Stuff like that. 
                    Because you don’t want to die. Not “I need that new smartphone” or 
                    “I saw these cool shoes in a store, I have to get them” or 
                    “This new video game is out, going to buy it tomorrow” or 
                    whatever else you can possibly come up with, none of these things actually matter. 
                    They are luxuries, <em> all of them</em>. And there is nothing wrong with luxuries in and of themselves, 
                    it is fine to enjoy them. It is wrong to center your whole life around them because 
                    that makes you lose focus of what really matters.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li><h4>There is nobody to judge you and neither to be judged by you</h4>
                    You want to run around naked? Or put on those fancy clothes you brought with you for 
                    whatever reason? Take a shit right beside your tent? Go ahead. Nobody will judge you. 
                    And soon you will realize how much of your behavior and life choices were a reaction to 
                    (the judgement of) society/the people around you. Because 99% of choices you make in life are 
                    choices that society put in front of you in the first place, they are artificial and 
                    you won’t come across them at the place you are at now. And there is nobody to be judged by you 
                    either! Because lets face it, everybody judges in some form or another. It is liberating 
                    to not judge. It frees your mind from all of that meaningless crap. Unless you judge the trees 
                    and flowers and animals, but they are perfect, so be careful who you judge, 
                    they might judge right back at you!
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li><h4>How important society actually is and what is wrong with it</h4>
                    As I said before, I am in no way talking about <em> fuck-society-everything-is-bad-about-it</em>. 
                    Humans are beings who naturally live in groups and we need other people to exist and be happy. 
                    Rules and laws are needed when living in groups, culture emerges naturally and society also 
                    provides a lot of value which can’t exist outside of it. You will realize that after two weeks 
                    in solitude, if you didn’t do so before. But there is something awfully wrong in the way we 
                    treat each other and the things we emphasize in life. And we can do better. In no way is it 
                    easy or trivial, but it is possible. What is the solution? Now that I can’t answer, certainly 
                    not in this post :) But living with nothing but plants and animals as neighbors for some time 
                    is a start, that I am sure of. Try it the next time you debate about where to go on vacation, 
                    cities and hotels will still be there waiting for you afterwards, I promise.
