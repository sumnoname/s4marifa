          Hi there, I'm a software developer from Germany and you just found my homepage.
          The page is new and I'm mainly using it to learn CSS and HTML, please bear with me!
          As you may have noticed, I will post poems and random thoughts about technology, society,
          spirituality and whatever else comes to my mind. I will mostly write in German, 
          with some stuff in English from time to time.
          In case you are wondering what <i>ma'rifa</i> means: It is an arabic word, used 
          in Sufism and means "the mystical intuitive knowledge of 
          spiritual truth reached through ecstatic experiences, rather than revealed or 
          rationally acquired". [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%27rifa">wikipedia</a>] 
          I hope you will find something interesting to read! :)
