          Hi there, I'm a software developer from Germany and you just found my homepage!
          As you may have noticed, I will post poems and random thoughts about technology, society,
          religion/spirituality and whatever else comes to my mind.
          In case you are wondering what <i>ma'rifa</i> means: 
          It is an arabic word and is used in Islam, especially in the mystical path of Sufism, and means
          "the mystical intuitive knowledge of spiritual truth reached through ecstatic experiences, rather than revealed or rationally acquired".

          I hope you will find something interesting and leave my page a little bit happier than when you arrived!
